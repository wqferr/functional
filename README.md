# lua-func
Functional programming utilities implemented in pure lua.

> The motivation behind this module is, again, portability.
If you want to embed this code on a webpage, or use it in some weird
system for which a C binding wouldn't work, this project is aimed
at you.

The docs can be found [here](https://wqferr.github.io/lua-func/), and were

# About
This module seeks to provide some utility functions and structures
which are too verbose in vanilla lua, in particular with regards to iteration
and inline function definition.

The module is writen completely in vanilla lua,
with no dependencies on external packages. This was a decision made for
portability, and has drawbacks. Since none of this was written as a C binding, it is not
as performant as it could be.

For example, [luafun](https://github.com/luafun/luafun)
is "high-performance functional programming library for Lua designed with
[LuaJIT](http://luajit.org/luajit.html)'s trace compiler in mind".
If your environment allows you to use LuaJIT and performance is a
concern, perhaps luafun will be more suited for your needs.
